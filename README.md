# Seq2Seq-Seq2Seq-w.-Attention-Summarization-2020
Two Sequence-to-Sequence DNN models for Summarizations using Pytorch

## Introduction

Codes contain 
1. Data Formatting (Using Pytorch objects : Field, TabularDataset, BucketIterator)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building (Element Stacking)
4. Summarization of a new sentence

## Structure
1. UDN_seq2seq : Sequence to Sequence LSTM
2. UDN_seq2attn : Sequence to Sequence GRU with Attention

## Notice
They are performed on the UDN data, which is not publicly available.  
However, the data preprocessing procedure and model structure and be applied to any text data.
